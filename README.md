The next generation of Network Next. See https://networknext.com

How is it different to the current Network Next? 

1. The server IP address is never exposed to clients, protecting servers from DDoS attack.
2. All clients are accelerated, helping you to get the most players around the world connecting to your game servers, even players in restritive countries like Mainland China.
3. All performance critical backends are written in XDP for maximum scalability and minimum cost.

IMPORTANT: This is pre-release software and is at least a year away from being production ready.
