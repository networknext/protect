The next generation of Network Next. See https://networknext.com

How is it different to the current Network Next? The server IP address is never exposed to clients, protecting it from DDoS attack.

All clients are accelerated, helping you to get the most players around the world connecting to your game servers, even players in restritive countries like Mainland China.

All performance critical backends are written in XDP for maximim scalability and minimum cost to operate.

IMPORTANT: This is pre-release software and is at least a year away from being production ready. Please [contact me](mailto:glenn@networknext.com) if it fits your use case.
