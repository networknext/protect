Client creates socket

Client socket is singlethreaded. No background thread. Just a UDP socket.

Client communicates directly to the backend over UDP.

Client is pumped at game framerate (60HZ variable, give or take...).

Client inits with backend and gets a backend token (as per-space game).

Client has to refresh this backend token at some rate, like every 60 seconds.

Client requests a ping token from the backend (passing in backend token) and gets it.

Client pings the relays its given for a certain amount of time (and is able to request a new set of ping tokens and repeat pings until it is happy with the a result)

Once the the client has the ping results, they can be accessed as a base64 string.

Passing up this base64 string to the backend, the client can now be given routes.

Aim to have multiple routes active at the same time. Refresh them once per-second, and be persistent, if we can't communicate over the routes retry until we can. Don't give up!
