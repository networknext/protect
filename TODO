    Implement the server zero copy packet receive interface on the server

    Actually read the sequence number for the direct packet and then adjust the packet data and packet bytes

    Verify that the server sees the packets sent from the client and the correct sequence number and packet bytes

    Convert the server over to have SoA for send buffer

    Convert the client to internally use a receive buffer.

    This will allow greater flexibility wrt. packet receiving and possibly we can do packet receives on a background thread with minimal effort.

    Implement a client background thread pumping the receive packet once every millisecond protected by mutex.

    Pump the receive packets once on main thread as will, right before we actually process them (to catch any packets in the last millisecond intra...)

TODO

    Design the ping near relay

    Requirements:

        1. Can have more relays to ping than can fit in one response packet

        2. Pass down lowest cost from each relay so we can self direct the optimization to give up early on relays that don't make sense

        3. The common case should be fast. If we have a lot of good relays with no packet loss and low jitter, we can stop after just one second.

        4. If we don't have any good relays that we can communicate across we can retry until we reach the connect timeout. The worst can be slower, but taking its time to connect.

        5. The client doesn't connect until it finds the route through the relays, so we don't have the first 10 seconds of the match being unaccelerated.

    I can mock up and test everything above with the sha256 hash, so the relay ping/pongs are compatible with the current fleet, so I can have a LOT of relays that I can ping.

    Implement handshake to pick a client slot (index)

    -------------

    Implement timeouts on the server side for client slots

    -------------

    Fix up all the hacked code to actually use client slot system when sending/receiving packets etc.

    Extend the server so it uses AF_XDP to send and receive packets on linux

    -------------

    Implement a server XDP program that does the packet filtering and checks for the server before passing down to userspace

    -------------
































    -------------

    Implement endian fix up for packet structs

    -------------

    Fix the connect token so we never send the user hash over un-encrypted channels

    This involves doing key exchange and switching over to more advanced crypto primitive

    Add these primitives to proton and then upgrade the code in protect to do the key exchange at the same time as processing the connect token
