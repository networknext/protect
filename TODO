DONE

    Switch over to libhydrogen in the SDK

    Verify that I can build hydrogen.c in the kernel module and it links and loads

    Setup a test linux server with 10G NIC with latitude.sh

    Verify that I get reflected UDP packets back from the client backend running on latitude.sh

    Update the write_connect_token and read_connect_token so they work with libhydrogen

    Generate a new keypair with hydrogen, because it's not compatible with sodium keypairs
    
    Setup to unit test again

    Add a unit test for connect token. Lock it in.

TODO

    Bring back other unit tests that are not related to client/server.

    -------------

    Define the client init request and response packets (keep them simple for XDP)

    -------------

    Implement the client parsing the connect token then sending the client init request packet to n backends until it receives a response per-backend

    -------------

    Implement the client_backend to the point where it can verify the client init request packet, and respond with the client init response packet

    -------------

    Extend the SDK client so it sends ping packets to the client backend and counts the number of pongs received per-backend in the connect token

    Implement code that the first to n pongs is the backend that we pick

    -------------
