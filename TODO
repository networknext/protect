DONE

    Set direct timeout to 10 seconds. We'll want the accelerated timeout to be much longer (30-60 seconds...)

    Implement a timeout on the direct client.

    Implement simplest possible direct connection -> client index slot on the server.

    Unify functions on the client when client connects, timeouts etc. so everything goes through one place.

    Implement a timeout on the server for direct connections.

    Client sends n disconnect packets to server when quitting direct.

    Server reads disconnect packets and disconnects client clean when it quits.

    SSH back into the linux box

TODO

    Implement the server XDP program

    This program should look at any UDP ports above 1000 and pass down to userspace only if they pass the packet filters and packet type tests

    Initially we can allow direct #if ALLOW_DIRECT but this should be off by default in future. Anytime the XDP program is run it is production ready.

    -------------

    Extend the server so it uses AF_XDP to send and receive packets on linux.

    -------------

    Implement a server XDP program that does the packet filtering before passing down packets to userspace

    -------------

    Disable packet filtering #ifdef __linux__, it's done in XDP

    -------------

    *** Good stopping point here ***

































    -------------

    Implement rate limiting in XDP x requests per-y seconds keyed on IP address

    -------------

    Fix the connect token so we never send the user hash over un-encrypted channels

    This involves doing key exchange and switching over to more advanced crypto primitive

    Add these primitives to proton and then upgrade the code in protect to do the key exchange at the same time as processing the connect token

    -------------

    Implement ip2location in client backend

    -------------

    Implement the client ping near relay design

    -------------

    Implement requesting a route and sending packets across it

    -------------

    Double this route and implement multipath
