    Implement the server zero copy packet receive interface on the server

    Actually read the sequence number for the direct packet and then adjust the packet data and packet bytes

    Verify that the server sees the packets sent from the client and the correct sequence number and packet bytes

TODO

    Do the same thing when receiving packets on the client (internally...)

    This will allow greater flexibility wrt. packet receiving and possibly we can do packet receives on a background thread with minimal effort.

    -------------

    There needs to be an actual handshake to pick a client slot (index)

    Start with a version of this using direct packets.

    -------------

    Extend the server so it uses AF_XDP to send and receive packets on linux

    -------------

    Implement a server XDP program that does the packet filtering and checks for the server before passing down to userspace

    -------------
































    -------------

    Implement endian fix up for packet structs

    -------------

    Fix the connect token so we never send the user hash over un-encrypted channels

    This involves doing key exchange and switching over to more advanced crypto primitive

    Add these primitives to proton and then upgrade the code in protect to do the key exchange at the same time as processing the connect token

    -------------

    Implement the ping near relays state of client init

    The trick here is that not only do we want the set of relays to ping, we also want...

    1. more relays to ping than can fit in one response packet

    2. an estimate of best cost from each relay to the destination

    This will allows us to quickly stop pinging relays that have demonstrated after 1 second that they are probably not suitable

    Think of it sort of a progressive refinement

    It also will let us in the common case very quickly decide, ok, these relays are fine, let's go.
