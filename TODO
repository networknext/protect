    Swap out send_mutex for atomic increment

    Verify that the send threads wake up and want to send 50 packets each (100 sent total)

    Make sure we clamp num_packets for XDP, since it will be using atomic increment, it can increment past the max packets sent

TODO

    OK we do have a major problem, which is that we don't have an easy way to get back from packet_data to the send queue

    We need the sequence # passed back in to finish packet / abort packet

    ----------

    Implement finish packet XDP

    Implement abort packet XDP

    We should now see each thread wanting to send 50 packets again

    ----------

    Create a separate frame allocator for receive packets vs. send packets.

    The first half of the umem will have frames for packet sends, the second half will be frames for packet receives.

    ----------

    Bring across as much code as possible to prep-packets and frames for sending, but don't actually send

    ----------

    Each socket needs to know the ethernet addresses, and the server ipv4 and port big endian.

    ----------

    Actually implement the packet send

    ----------

    Verify the client receives packets from the server.

    ----------

    Verify that packets are sent across both send threads.

    ----------

    Server AF_XDP is basically working at this point!













    -------------

    Implement rate limiting in XDP x requests per-y seconds keyed on IP address

    -------------

    Fix the connect token so we never send the user hash over un-encrypted channels

    This involves doing key exchange and switching over to more advanced crypto primitive

    Add these primitives to proton and then upgrade the code in protect to do the key exchange at the same time as processing the connect token

    -------------

    Implement ip2location in client backend

    -------------

    Implement the client ping near relay design

    -------------

    Implement requesting a route and sending packets across it

    -------------

    Double this route and implement multipath
