    ----------

    Add a unit test for connect token. Lock it in.

    -------------

    Define the client init request and response packets (keep them simple for XDP)

    -------------

    Implement the client parsing the connect token then sending the client init request packet to n backends until it receives a response per-backend

    -------------

    Implement the client_backend to the point where it can verify the client init request packet, and respond with the client init response packet

    -------------

    Extend the SDK client so it sends ping packets to the client backend and counts the number of pongs received per-backend in the connect token

    Implement code that the first to n pongs is the backend that we pick
