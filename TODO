DONE

    Switch over to libhydrogen in the SDK

    Verify that I can build hydrogen.c in the kernel module and it links and loads

    Setup a test linux server with 10G NIC with latitude.sh

    Verify that I get reflected UDP packets back from the client backend running on latitude.sh

    Update the write_connect_token and read_connect_token so they work with libhydrogen

    Generate a new keypair with hydrogen, because it's not compatible with sodium keypairs
    
    Setup to unit test again

    Add a unit test for connect token. Lock it in.

    Bring back other unit tests that are not related to client/server.

    Move CMake shit into "build" dir because it's terrible

TODO

    Define and unit test the client backend token

    -------------

    Define the client init request and response packets (keep them simple for XDP)

    -------------

    Implement the client sending the client init request packet to n backends until it receives n responses from a backend.

    -------------

    Implement client backend XDP program verifying client init request packet using hydrogen, and responding with a client backend token (symmetric encrypted).

    -------------
