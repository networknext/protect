    Switch to packet struct when sending client init request packet

    Remove config. We really don't need it. Client can configure fully with connect token, and the server can just read env vars or do its own config if it needs to.

    Implement the code that fails to connect after the connect timeout is reached

    The connect timeout should be specified in the connect token so the client is zero configuration

    Verify that we can have the client backend shut down, and the client will give up after a while and go to error state

    Extend the connect token so it has the backend token refresh rate in it (30 seconds...)

    Implement the code on the client to request to refresh the backend token

    This will need to include retries (once per-second until we get a response...)

    Implement the backend responding to the refresh backend token request with a new encrypted backend token

TODO

    Verify the client gets the refresh token response packet

    -------------

    Implement the client processing the refresh token response, stashing the updated backend token and setting the next refresh to n seconds in future

    -------------

    Verify that the client sits and refreshes backend token post-init every 30 seconds

    -------------

    Read the client backend private key from env var when the client backend starts up

    Stick the client backend private key in the client backend config map

    -------------

    Implement the client backend state map

    Set the current time in the client backend state map once per-second

    Get the current time in XDP from the state map

    -------------

    Verify that the client can connect and refresh backend tokens without having them expire for 5 minutes+

    -------------

    Implement the client backend buyer map

    This map goes from buyer id to data for the buyer

    In the buyer struct, we will have the buyer public key

    Then, we can update the XDP program to get the buyer public key from the buyer map

    -------------

    Generalize everything so it works across big and little endian machines.

    Do it by byte swapping so we don't have to do per-field serialization. Keep it simple.

    -------------

    Fix the connect token so we never send the user hash over un-encrypted channels

    -------------

    If an IP address is passed in instead of a connect token, just go straight to "CONNECTED" state on the client and send and receive passthrough packets.

    This is the simplest possible way to make it super easy to test during development.

    This payload packet codepath must be disabled in the shipping build, so even if you know the server IP address, you cannot connect to it.
