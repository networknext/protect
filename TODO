DONE

    Get 10gbps packet send working with AF_XDP!

    Now it's time to land the plane

    Get the xdp server processing direct packets, adding new connections, doing timeouts etc.

    Once this is done I can bring this code across to a test project and test it in-place in a real game engine.

    Fixed some issues around from address and port

    Fixed disconnect packet not getting through by changing to packet_bytes >= 18

    Server is not resetting the send sequence number for a client when it times out.

    Update hulk with https://github.com/networknext/ethernet-linux-ixgbe

TODO
    
    Implement env vars read by the server, where you can specify the public address and port so we can stop hard coding this.

    Default should still remain 127.0.0.1:40000 for local testing, but the env var will override this so the service is configurable.

    ---------

    Implement the map setting the public address and port, and only pass packets down to the server AF_XDP socket if they match.
    
    ---------

    Add an env var for the number of queues and then dynamically allocate these # of queues on the next server.

    This way we can adjust from one machine type to another. Right now the number of queues is hard coded and this is very inflexible.

    ---------

    Setup space1 server so it sends 10gbps of traffic to space2 server and see how much CPU it takes on the send side.

    ---------

    Debug why I'm not seeing packets sent on ixgbe driver, but it's working fine on i40e driver.

    ---------

    Need to work out how to reserve CPUs cores for AF_XDP so they are available for packet processing and not taking up by game code and physics.

    ---------

    Get started integrating the new network next sockets with space game.
