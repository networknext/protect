    Switch to packet struct when sending client init request packet

    Remove config. We really don't need it. Client can configure fully with connect token, and the server can just read env vars or do its own config if it needs to.

    Implement the code that fails to connect after the connect timeout is reached

    The connect timeout should be specified in the connect token so the client is zero configuration

    Verify that we can have the client backend shut down, and the client will give up after a while and go to error state

    Extend the connect token so it has the backend token refresh rate in it (30 seconds...)

    Implement the code on the client to request to refresh the backend token

    This will need to include retries (once per-second until we get a response...)

    Implement the backend responding to the refresh backend token request with a new encrypted backend token

    Verify the client gets the refresh token response packet

    Implement the client processing the refresh token response, stashing the updated backend token and setting the next refresh to n seconds in future

    Verify that the client sits and refreshes backend token post-init every 30 seconds

    Implement the client backend state map

    Set the current time in the client backend state map once per-second

    Get the current time in XDP from the state map

    Verify that the client can connect and refresh backend tokens without having them expire for 10 minutes

    Read the client backend private key from env var when the client backend starts up

    Stick the client backend private key in the client backend config map

    Update the XDP program so it gets client backend public and private keys from the config map

    Implement the client backend buyer map

    Update XDP program to get buyer public key from map

    First, verify that if we can't look up from buyer id then we fail with unknown buyer

    Then mock up the buyer public key in client_backend_main.c for now to have the expected value we want

    Verify that the client can init again

    Bring across the zero copy send packet data structures and functions

TODO

    Use the zero copy interface to send packets to all connected clients

    -------------

    Mock client 0 being connected and verify that we can send packets to it

    -------------

    Generalize packet send so there is next_server_send_packet (payload) and there is next_server_send_packet_internal

    -------------

    Bring across zero copy receive packet functions

    Use the zero copy interface to print logs when the server receives payload packets from clients

    -------------

    If an IP address is passed in instead of a connect token, just go straight to "CONNECTED" state on the client and send and receive passthrough packets.

    This is the simplest possible way to make it super easy to test during development.

    -------------

    Extend the server so it uses AF_XDP to send and receive packets on linux

    -------------

    Implement a server XDP program that does the packet filtering and checks for the server before passing down to userspace

    -------------
































    -------------

    Implement endian fix up for packet structs

    -------------

    Fix the connect token so we never send the user hash over un-encrypted channels

    This involves doing key exchange and switching over to more advanced crypto primitive

    Add these primitives to proton and then upgrade the code in protect to do the key exchange at the same time as processing the connect token

    -------------

    Implement the ping near relays state of client init

    The trick here is that not only do we want the set of relays to ping, we also want...

    1. more relays to ping than can fit in one response packet

    2. an estimate of best cost from each relay to the destination

    This will allows us to quickly stop pinging relays that have demonstrated after 1 second that they are probably not suitable

    Think of it sort of a progressive refinement

    It also will let us in the common case very quickly decide, ok, these relays are fine, let's go.
