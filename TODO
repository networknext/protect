    Implement the client sending the client init request packet to n backends until it receives a response. For any zero client backend address, do nothing.

    Uhoh. We can't just send the connect token to the client backend because it contains the user hash (personal data)

    So we have to extend the connect token so it has an encrypted part, and this will require asymmetric encryption, since the buyer creates the connect token.

    Implement part where we send the client backend init request packet to the client backend during init

    Implement client backend XDP program verifying client init request packet using hydrogen, and responding with an encrypted client backend token

    Hook up hydro_sign_verify in next_module

    I have some work to do to get hydro compiling in the kernel module

    Work through it until we get the connect token verifying in the XDP module and responding with a reflected packet

    Extend the kernel module so we have access to secretbox encrypt/decrypt

    We need definitions of the next_connect_token_t and the next_backend_token_t inside the XDP program and the client backend

    Build a next_backend_token_t in response to the client init request and send it back to the client

    Verify the client still gets the response

    Encrypt the backend token

TODO

    Implement the secretbox_encrypt function in the kernel module

    Verify the encrypt succeeds and the client backend responds

    -------------

    Resize the response packet

    -------------

    Verify the client gets the client init response packet and can decrypt it

    -------------

    The client must check the request id vs. the request and ignore if it doesn't match

    -------------

    Add client backend state and put current_timestamp in it once per-second

    -------------

    Check for connect token expiry in client init request handler

    -------------

    Now transition per-client backend from sending client init packets to sending client backend pings once the client init response is received:

    Client backend ping packet:

        [2] (17 byte header) (client backend token) (uint64 request_id)
        [3] (17 byte header) (uint64 request id)

    -------------

    Implement XDP program to verify that the client backend token decrypts

    -------------

    Generalize everything so it works across big and little endian machines.

    Do it by byte swapping so we don't have to do per-field serialization. Keep it simple.

    -------------

    Fix the connect token so we never send the user hash over un-encrypted channels

    -------------
