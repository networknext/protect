DONE

    Now I'm getting weird hung and disconnected when I run the server xdp program?

    I've requested a second IP address for the new york server, so I can load the XDP program on the second NIC (while SSH'ing in on the first NIC)

    They just statically redirected the second IP to the first, doing nothing. So I cancelled the server.

    I will setup my hulk linux machine and work in my lab instead.

    Get hulk up and running so I can send packets with AF_XDP

    Fixed the bug that was breaking the NIC. Bad offset values were crashing out the NIC.

    Now check if we can send a subset of the frames we reserved and not run out of send queue.

    We cannot. At this point I think it's correct to accept that we must reserve and send the number of packets we say.

    This means we need two interfaces, a regular, memcpy once interface for sending packets. Looks just like the non-XDP way.

    And then we have this zero copy interface, where you specifically have to call out the number of packets to send and you *must* send that many packets. 

    OK I fixed the mac address byte order, it was reversed, and now the client on the mac receives the packets sent from the linux AF_XDP program.

    Keep it simple and just do a non-zero copy (one copy) method of sending packets.

    At the end of sending packets, the send packets call will do the XDP stuff. It's simple.

    Later on if we need the zero copy stuff for some reason, we can add that, but it's probably overkill.

    Might be cool to also do a "broadcast" eg. to all connected clients, and then we really can do some sweet XDP stuff with it.

    We are also going to need to copy for the two multipath as well, so ...

    OK. Recovered the simple send packet setup for the server, 

    Now hook up AF_XDP to send the packets in batches in next_server_send_packets (send as much as it can... warn if it can't send all...

TODO

    -------------

    Verify the client receives packets sent to it from AF_XDP

    -------------

    Implement receive with AF_XDP

    -------------

    Verify the server receives packets sent to it from the client via AF_XDP

    -------------

    *** Good stopping point here ***

































    -------------

    Implement rate limiting in XDP x requests per-y seconds keyed on IP address

    -------------

    Fix the connect token so we never send the user hash over un-encrypted channels

    This involves doing key exchange and switching over to more advanced crypto primitive

    Add these primitives to proton and then upgrade the code in protect to do the key exchange at the same time as processing the connect token

    -------------

    Implement ip2location in client backend

    -------------

    Implement the client ping near relay design

    -------------

    Implement requesting a route and sending packets across it

    -------------

    Double this route and implement multipath

    -------------
