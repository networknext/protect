    Sketch out client

    Sketch out server

    Generalize relay module so it's the "network next" kernel module instead. It can be used by server, and by backends.

    Setup terraform on the project and build SDK and relay

    I'd like to build the relay module separately, and actually test building it and installing it works?

    OK all the stuff is building in semaphore.

    Can we switch over from libsodium to libhydrogen on the client, since the client will really not benefit significantly from any advanced assembly shit?

    This way we could avoid using our franken-libsodium in most places, and then link on the server to libsodium for fast routines where it matters (or do it all in XDP?)

    No, because libhydrogen does not support SHA256 hashinrg, and it only supports Gimli hash, which the linux kernel does not support

TODO

    Implement the client_backend as a test

    After doing this, generalize the functionality so we can re-use code across multiple backend and the relay.
