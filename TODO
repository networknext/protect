Necessary components:

    ----------------

    Start with SDK

    I want a client SDK with no threads for packet send and receive

    ----------------

    Server should have a process running that handles the network next stuff in XDP

    Minimal, if any, changes made on the server-side to packet processing

    No packets read on a background thread, XDP for the parts that need to respond right away

    ----------------
