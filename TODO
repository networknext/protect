    Sketch out client

    Sketch out server

    Generalize relay module so it's the "network next" kernel module instead. It can be used by server, and by backends.

    Setup terraform on the project and build SDK and relay

    I'd like to build the relay module separately, and actually test building it and installing it works?

    OK all the stuff is building in semaphore.

TODO

    Sequence of operations I want:

        1. Client generates a connect token (this would be given to it by the game backend...). This connect token basically says "this client user hash wants to connect to server id X"

        2. The client passes this connect token to the client backend, which auths it (JWT style)

        3. The 

        3. The client takes the connect token and pings the near relays, and then passes up that connect token + the relay ping results to the "client backend" over UDP (golang for now...)

        4. The client backend checks the connect token and the ping results and returns an initial route to the client

    ------
    
    Implement server with XDP (so we can do relay-like stuff and respond immediately to pings etc.

    Sketch out some sort of AF_XDP server with a bpf map registering, yes, I'm this server id on this port.

    ------

    Should we implement client and server backend in XDP? I think yes. We want this to be as scalable and low-cost as possible

    Sketch out client backend

    Sketch out server backend

    Extend relay to support packets that close sessions
