    Sketch out client

    Sketch out server

    Generalize relay module so it's the "network next" kernel module instead. It can be used by server, and by backends.

    Setup terraform on the project and build SDK and relay

    I'd like to build the relay module separately, and actually test building it and installing it works?

    OK all the stuff is building in semaphore.

TODO
    
    Implement server with XDP (so we can do relay-like stuff and respond immediately to pings etc.

    Sketch out some sort of AF_XDP server with a bpf map registering, yes, I'm this server id on this port.

    ------

    Should we implement client and server backend in XDP? I think yes. We want this to be as scalable and low-cost as possible
