DONE

    Implement the server zero copy packet receive interface on the server

    Actually read the sequence number for the direct packet and then adjust the packet data and packet bytes

    Verify that the server sees the packets sent from the client and the correct sequence number and packet bytes

    Convert the server over to have SoA for send buffer

    Convert the client to internally use a receive buffer.

    This will allow greater flexibility wrt. packet receiving and possibly we can do packet receives on a background thread with minimal effort.

    Implement a client background thread pumping the receive packet once every millisecond protected by mutex.

    Pump the receive packets once on main thread as will, right before we actually process them (to catch any packets in the last millisecond intra...)

    Ignore any init that doesn't come from the client public address in the connect token

    Extend the client backend token so it tracks client address and port

    Ignore any client backend requests that don't come from the client IP and port in the client backend token

    Implement endian fix up for packet structs

    Pass over the packet processing in XDP and call endian_fix as needed

TODO

    *** Good stopping point here ***

    -------------

    Implement handshake to pick a client slot (index)

    Implement timeouts on the server side for client slots

    Fix up all the hacked code to actually use client slot system when sending/receiving packets etc.

    -------------

    Extend the server so it uses AF_XDP to send and receive packets on linux

    -------------

    Implement a server XDP program that does the packet filtering before passing down packets to userspace

    -------------

    *** Good stopping point here ***

    -------------

    Implement rate limiting in XDP x requests per-y seconds keyed on IP address

    -------------

    Fix the connect token so we never send the user hash over un-encrypted channels

    This involves doing key exchange and switching over to more advanced crypto primitive

    Add these primitives to proton and then upgrade the code in protect to do the key exchange at the same time as processing the connect token

    -------------

    Implement ip2location in client backend

    -------------

    Implement the client ping near relay design

    -------------

    Implement requesting a route and sending packets across it

    -------------

    Double this route and implement multipath

    -------------
